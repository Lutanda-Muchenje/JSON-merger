HOW TO RUN THIS TOOL:
1. Download the whole project
2. Extract the file
3. In your command line, go to the extracted folder called "json-cli" inside "JSON-merger"
4. type "node json-cli {a relative directory path}" (if it is a single layer e.g. folder1 and NOT folder1/folder2, DO NOT ADD "/" it is added automatically)
5. if the directory path is a single layer e.g. folder1 and NOT folder1/folder2, DO NOT ADD "./" it is added automatically
6. press ENTER
7. If there are no errors, a json file is created in the same directory as the json-cli file, the contents are also printed in the CLI
